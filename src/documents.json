  "Body": "TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Spokesman for the Covid-19 Task Force, Wiku Adisasmito, confirmed the number of daily positive cases dropped by 40 percent in the past seven days. This fact could possibly be a signal for the government to relax the social restrictions dubbed the Emergency PPKM which will last until July 25.“As President Jokowi said, the Emergency PPKM will be relaxed gradually if daily cases decline in the next six days. When observed in the past seven days, positive cases have decreased from 56,757 on July 15 to 33,772 on July 21, or by 40 percent,” said Wiku in an online press conference on Thursday, July 22.In addition, he informed that the number of recoveries increased by more than 70 percent. “Based on the percentage of active cases, there is a decline over the last three days. The daily BOR (hospital bed occupancy rate) has also consistently dropped over the last three days from 76.26 percent to 72.82 percent,” Wiku outlined.However, Indonesia is still facing challenges on the death toll caused by the coronavirus infection. Almost all provinces showed a rising trend in the mortality rate, except Jakarta. In the last six days, the number of deaths always hit more than 1,000.“This cannot be tolerated anymore because this is not just a number,” Wiku added.President Jokowi on Tuesday said the Covid-19 restrictions will be relaxed on July 26 if the number of cases is starting to decline during the extension period of the Emergency PPKM from July 21-25.Read: Emergency PPKM Relaxation Plan; Govt Urged to Use Valid DataEGI ADYATAMA",

  "Title": "Indonesian Startups Targeting Public Investors with IPO",
  "Body": "TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - IPO process by Indonesian startups is going to increase funds for the future business expansion. The rapid growth of technology has spawned many industries to expand their businesses in the digital ecosystem. Therefore, as the start-up companies spring up they also compete with each other to be in the forefront. One of the efforts to improve their performance is by obtaining fresh sources of funds through the Initial Public Offering (IPO) scheme.IPO is the process of offering new shares to the public in the open market. Through this offering, it is possible for companies to obtain capital from public investors. Companies that have passed the IPO process are no longer owned by individuals, but by public investors.Esa Soeryaningrum, the Program Director of the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (INDEF) and a Lecturer in the Faculty of Economics and Business, Diponegoro University said that there are various purposes of a company’s decision in doing an IPO. Besides improving their financial, the funds can also be used to accelerate the expansion of the company's growth.\"In addition, an IPO not only can improve the company's credibility but also can be a marketing tool for the company. By going public, the company value will increase considerably in the future, along with its stock price,\" Esa told Tempo on May, 5th 2021.One of the start-up companies that is currently preparing an IPO on the stock exchange is Tokopedia. The Indonesian technology company is planning to do a dual listing in Indonesia and the United States. More than a year ago, Tokopedia has continued to encourage the realization of positive Earning Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) so that they can enter the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) as soon as possible.Responding to this preparation, Esa said that this was the right step. Through the IPO process, Tokopedia can increase the capital to support its future business expansion, \"However, this IPO is better for the domestic investors, as Tokopedia will increasingly support the sale of local products,\" she said.Esa explained that there are several stages that Tokopedia needs to prepare upon conducting an IPO. Some of these things include obtaining approval from stakeholders and preparing underwriters for conducting an IPO, submitting an application for listing of shares to the IDX and a registration statement with the Financial Services Authority (OJK), as well as a brief prospectus and public exposure when the OJK has issued a public permit.\"Furthermore, companies can go public to sell stocks in the open market, after the company registration statement is declared effective by the OJK. The IDX will give approval and announce the listing of the company's shares along with the stock code for purposes on the stock exchange. After that, investors can trade the company's stocks to other investors through securities companies that are members of the stock exchanges listed on the IDX,” explained Esa.Esa also explained that the large capital opportunities that Tokopedia might get after going public will have consequences for Tokopedia to work with optimal quality. This will also have an impact on shareholders in increasing sales due to Tokopedia's improved credibility.Esa revealed that the preparations made by Tokopedia for the IPO were good to be imitated by other startup companies. Not only for profit, but also in order to achieve the company's vision and mission, supporting the improvement of the national economy. \"It is time for the start-ups in Indonesia to develop their business through IPOs for expansion,\" she said.(*)INFO TEMPO",

  "Title": "MSMEs Need to Survive from Marketplace Cross-border Onslaught",
  "Body": "TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Foreign sellers on cross-border marketplace pose a threat to local MSME business sustainability.The adoption of digitalization is growing at warp speed. Digital transformation is happening across sectors, including the way Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)/Usaha Mikro, Kecil dan Menengah (UMKM) conduct their businesses through digital platforms like marketplaces.There are 2 types of marketplace business models; local and cross-border. The local or domestic marketplace is a marketplace platform that only facilitates transactions within one country.  Whereas, the cross-border marketplace allows foreign merchants to transact directly with buyers on the platform by sending the goods from the merchant's home country.According to Esa Soeryaningrum, the Program Director of the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (INDEF) and a Lecturer in the Faculty of Economics and Business, Diponegoro University, currently the cross-border marketplaces are quite developed in Indonesia due to the rapid growth of the digital ecosystem. “Cross-border marketplaces have the opportunity to get more customers because they market globally,” she said.However, the cross-border marketplace benefits turned out to bring pros and cons in Indonesia. “The problem now is many imported product prices are lower than local products which actually have better quality. As a result, local goods are less attractive to Indonesian customers,” said Esa.Even though the competition with the foreign products on one hand can indeed motivate local MSMEs to continue innovating, the exemption of goods purchase and price which reported undervaluation could make local MSMEs less competitive.Joko Widodo, the President some time ago even started the movement to love domestic products and \"hate\" imported products. This statement is based on the potential trading in foreign products of the cross-border marketplace that could kill the local MSMEs. In fact, unfortunately, local MSMEs have some difficulties in penetrating the export market, due to the needs of large capital, connections, large stocks and also marketing difficulties.In addition to the competition from imported products, foreign sellers who sell goods below the local market prices also pose a serious threat to the local businesses. They do illegal cross-border practice on e-commerce platforms in which the products do not officially go through the custom and excise, hence sold at very cheap prices.Regarding this, Esa said that the Indonesian government needs to regulate the digital marketplace, either local or cross-border. Now, the government is currently working on the regulations related to digital taxes, especially to reinforce various cross-border marketplaces that do not comply with applicable regulations related to taxes and selling price provisions.“To create ideal conditions for all parties, it is necessary to start with the government as a regulator. Regulations can help create ideal market conditions as well as regulating the market fairly for all parties involved,” said Esa.The Indonesian government has actually strengthened the supervision and regulations related to the existence of cross-border marketplaces through an electronic data integration system created by the Directorate General of Customs and Excise, the Ministry of Finance. This regulates the circulation of imported goods through e-commerce so that they are running in an equal playing field of this business competition, between local and imported goods.Meanwhile, marketplace platforms that are already in operation can later adjust to these regulations. Support for government efforts in securing MSMEs is needed from various parties, especially marketplace platform providers.“The marketplace platform providers need to improve its features by providing information on the origin of goods, both direct import and imported goods sold by local sellers. So far, there are only features of the origin of the seller,” said Esa.Esa exemplifies several cross-border marketplaces in Indonesia, such as Alibaba, Shopee or Amazon. Meanwhile, e-commerce platforms such as Tokopedia, Bukalapak, and Sayurbox are categorized as domestic marketplaces.“The existence of online media makes it easier for cross-border marketplaces to operate in Indonesia. Unfortunately, if it is not properly regulated, local entrepreneurs have the potential to suffer losses because their products will be unable to compete with illegal cross-border products which are much cheaper,” Esa added.(*)INFO TEMPO",

  "Title": "Tokopedia's Strategy in Becoming the Indonesian Marketplace Leader",
  "Body": "TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Based on the “e-conomy SEA 2020 Report” issued by Google, Temasek and Bain Company, Indonesia has the highest transaction value in Southeast Asia with an economic value up to $44 billion in 2020 and is also predicted to reach $124 billion by 2025.The digital economy in Indonesia continues to grow by double digits with the e-commerce and online media sectors as the largest contributors. Currently, the Southeast Asia region is also considered as one of the most promising digital economy markets in the world.Tokopedia, one of Indonesia's local marketplaces, responded to this situation with a commitment of #SelaluAdaSelaluBisa (Always Present, Always Able) to meet the needs of all its users, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic.“During Covid-19 pandemic situation, Tokopedia believes that the digital platform like marketplace is a solution for providing consumer needs and running a business in the current situation of tight activity restrictions,” said Inna Chandika, VP of Marketplace of Tokopedia.Inna said that Tokopedia will continue to focus on helping the entrepreneurs, especially local Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) by accelerating the adoption of digital platforms. This was done in order to maintain business activities and to contribute to the recovery of the national economy.Various actions and strategies were carried out, one of it was the #JagaEkonomiIndonesia campaign along with the national movement #BanggaBuatanIndonesia (Proud of Indonesian-made). According to Inna, this action is intended to attract more Indonesians to fulfill their needs from the comfort of their homes and to inspire more businesses to transform online, hence encouraging the national economic recovery.“In addition, Tokopedia is also actively collaborating with entrepreneurs through various activities, such as Tokopedia Nyam, Tokopedia Beauty Dealight, TokoMart and many others,” said Inna.As part of the company’s strategy to attract more people to shop online amidst the pandemic, the company also launched ‘Waktu Indonesia Belanja’ (WIB) (Indonesian Shopping Time) campaign. This is a regular shopping program by Tokopedia held every month from the 25th until the end of the month, offering added value that make people's shopping experiences more attractive and efficient.“WIB is a form of our commitment to help Indonesians find products and services easily from home. This also adapts to the Indonesian traditions who are accustomed to do shopping on payday,” said Inna.Inna also added that the company has been very bold in their commitment to serving the regions across the archipelago through their hyperlocal initiative. “As an Indonesian technology company serving only Indonesian market, we put high importance on advancing local businesses in regions across the country to drive regional economic growth,” she said. “We provide various special pages such as Kumpulan Toko Pilihan (KTP) and TokoMart which has geo-tagging technology to make it easier for people to get daily necessities from the nearest sellers,” she added.Another form of Tokopedia's hyperlocal initiative is the digitalization of traditional markets. One of them is Pasar Cikurubuk Online which has managed to record an increase in orders of up to 4 times since joining Tokopedia. Meanwhile, the Pasar Sehat Sabilulungan Cicalengka also managed to record an increase in orders more than two times during the first quarter of 2021.Another effective strategy that has been implemented by Tokopedia to become the leading marketplace in Indonesia is to collaborate with music groups from South Korea, BTS and BLACKPINK. It is an effort to keep up with the Indonesian market from the millennial generation and generation Z. “Tokopedia has also become the first company in the world to collaborate with these two South Korean megastars at the same time,” she added.“Through these various initiatives, we have seen a surge in buyers and sellers on our platform. Based on Tokopedia's internal data, there are more than 11 million sellers serving more than 100 million monthly active users spread across 99 percent of districts in Indonesia,” said Inna.Esa Soeryaningrum, the Program Director of the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (INDEF) and a Lecturer in the Faculty of Economics and Business, Diponegoro University said that various efforts and strategies from Tokopedia will bring good to all parties, both in the micro and macro-economic spheres. “This is Tokopedia’s way to increase its size, both in terms of capital and market, so that Tokopedia’s market share in Indonesia will be wider,” told her.Meanwhile, Inna said, the growth of the Tokopedia business as an Indonesian technology company can be one of the driving forces for Indonesia's national economic growth. “We will continue to focus on building a Super Ecosystem where everyone can start and discover anything to achieve our mission of democratizing commerce through technology in Indonesia,” said Inna.(*)INFO TEMPO",

  "Body": "TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto said the government had prepared incentives worth Rp1.2 million for owners of micro-businesses, such as kiosks, food stalls or locally known as warteg, and street vendors.The aid disbursement was aimed at helping small-scale entrepreneurs who were affected by the extension of the emergency state of social restrictions (PPKM) or PPKM Level 4 that would last until July 25, 2021. Airlangga said this program was similar to the cash aid program for MSMEs.“The mechanism is regulated in the general guidelines and technical instructions. The distribution is under the National Armed Forces (TNI) and the National Police (Polri) and is also assisted by the Finance Ministry and the Development Finance Comptroller (BPKP),” he explained.The authorities, Airlangga went on, will later collect the names of recipients and verify the data from the local offices of the Manpower Ministry. The data collection will be based on the Population Identification Number (NIK) which has passed the cleansing through the BPKP.“We certainly need data related to the type of business, the business location, and NIK of the micro-entrepreneurs. This will be part of the government’s upcoming programs,” Airlangga said.Read: Introducing New Covid-19 Restriction Terms; PPKM Level 4, Level 3ANTARA",

  "Title": "Sri Mulyani Highlights 4 Obstacles to Global Economic Recovery",
  "Body": "TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati has highlighted four risks that could hamper global economic recovery since the first half of 2021.\"Even though there was a positive and very good performance in the first half of 2021, we saw that there were risks that also emerged in the first half, especially in the second quarter,\" she said at the KiTA APBN press conference on Wednesday.The first risk has been the emergence of the Delta variant of the coronavirus, which has increased the possibility of tightening of restrictions on public activities, hampering normal activities in many countries, she added.The Delta variant has had a tremendous impact on the society and economy in March, April and May this year, and now the variant has spread to more than 130 countries, Indrawati noted.Moreover, cases of the Delta variant have surged in the United States (US) and the United Kingdom after the two countries implemented massive vaccination programs, she pointed out.The next risk has been the uneven implementation of the vaccination program among countries and within one country, leading to differences in pandemic control and economic recovery, Sri Mulyani said.Vaccinations are currently not evenly distributed because some people are not ready to get vaccinated, as seen in several states in the US, she added. Some communities in several countries in Africa and Asia do not even have access to the program, she continued.\"Vaccination access and vaccination penetration capabilities pose risks, as the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the cause of COVID-19, will continue to be contagious and mutate as long as the disease is not treated properly,\" the finance minister cautioned.Furthermore, the third risk has been an increase in inflation above five percent in two consecutive months in the US, or well above the inflation target of around two percent, she said.The increase has affected the purchasing power of the American public, especially in the middle and lower groups, and threatened recovery, as well as given rise to various projections of the Federal Reserve's (Fed) measures in response to inflation, she added.The last risk has been supply disruptions and rising inflation in many countries, especially developed countries, which are affecting production and increasing production costs, she pointed out.\"We see various possibilities from the supply and the increase in inflation to production around the world,” said minister Sri Mulyani.Read also: Sri Mulyani Says Tax will Help Country Survive Pandemic PressureANTARA",

The remaining 50 percent, he said, will be paid by the firms.\"Say a worker's salary is Rp3 million per month, the government pays half of it or Rp1.5 million. So, shopping center managements only have to pay another Rp1.5 million,\" he said in an online press conference, Wednesday, July 21.\"Thus, workers will receive their wages in full, and the government subsidy would help the businesses [financially],\" he added.According to Alphonzus, this needs to be done to reduce the potential of job cuts. Currently, he said, most of the workers have been laid off, yet they are still being paid their full salaries. Although, he admitted that several job cuts were unavoidable.If the Emergency PPKM is further extended, several workers will be laid off with salaries not paid in full, with job cuts to still be on the table.\"These stages depend on how long the emergency PPKM lasts. We hope that the last option of layoffs will not happen. Therefore, we ask the government to help reduce the burdens of shopping centers,\" Alphonzus said.The government officially extended the implementation of Emergency PPKM until July 25, 2021. Economic activity will be relaxed on July 26, if the average daily addition of Covid-19 positive cases shows improvement.Read: Emergency PPKM Extended, Shopping Centers Urge Govt to Grant SubsidiesMuhammad Hendartyo | Maudey K.

  "Body": "TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Criminal sanctions will be imposed towards the violators of health protocols in Jakarta. This is currently being discussed in the revision of Jakarta Regional Regulation No. 2 of 2020 regarding Covid-19 Response.Head of the Regional Regulation Formation Agency (Bapemperda) of the Jakarta DPRD, Pantas Nainggolan, said that the imposition of criminal sanctions towards the violators of health protocols will be in accordance with criminal law procedures.\"The procedure will be more or less criminal procedural law, for example minor crime (tipiring), such as traffic violations,\" he said at the Jakarta DPRD Building, Central Jakarta, Wednesday, July 21, 2021.The Jakarta government proposes a revision of Regional Regulation (Perda) 2/2020 considering the increasing number of Covid-19 positive and death cases. The current Perda 2/2020 is considered not effective to stricten public’s health protocols.The draft revised regional regulation contains two new articles. The two articles regulate the investigation authority for civil servants and the Public Order Agency (Satpol PP) as well as criminal sanctions for violators who repeat mistakes. The DPRD is currently discussing the proposed revision.Criminal procedure law means that the case will be brought to trial. In the revised draft of Perda 2/2020, civil servant investigators or Satpol PP need to notify the police of the start of the investigation. The results of the investigation were also submitted to the police and the District Court.The Police will later decide whether or not the case is determined as a criminal offense, referring to the revised Regional Regulation.\"The sanction can be a fine or the alternative is imprisonment,\" said the PDIP politician.The revision of Perda 2/2020 will expand health protocol violation types. The Jakarta Government has added criminal sanctions in the form of imprisonment or fines for repeat offenders. This sanction will be applied to individuals, offices, and other business actors.Read also: Anies Baswedan to Revise Covid-19 Rule: Sanctions Have No Deterrent EffectLANI DIANA WIJAYA | MAUDEY K.

  "Title": "Forest Fires Drive Sumatran tiger Out of Their Habitats",
  "Body": "TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Indonesia, home to the Sumatran tiger, joined celebrations on International Tiger Day, observed on July 25, to raise support for the conservation of tigers.The Sumatran tiger is the only surviving tiger in the country, and the smallest of the five tiger subspecies in the world. In the 1970s, the number of Sumatran tigers had reached some 1,000, though the figure decreased to 800 by the 1980s. Currently, the population is believed to be between 400 and 600 tigers.In earlier days, Indonesia was home to three tiger species, including the Bali tiger, which became extinct in 1940, and the Java tiger, declared extinct in the 1980s.While environmentalists, experts and officials campaigned during Global Tiger Day, still, the few remaining Sumatran tigers have to struggle to survive, as Sumatra Island has been ravaged by hundreds of hotspots, similar to forest fires, since July 2019.Riau Province on Sumatra Island has been the most affected by forest fires. Wildfires also broke out in the province’s Tesso Nilo, a 81,700-hectare national park, which is a habitat for critically endangered tigers and elephants.A video of a tiger running near the fence of the Chevron facility in Siak District, Riau, went viral in early August 2019.Head of the Riau BBKSDA (Natural Resource Conservation Office) Suharyono confirmed the receipt of information from Vice President External Affairs of Chevron Hasim M. Noor explaining that the video was taken by a security guard at Kilometer 5 of the eastern Trans-Sumatra road near Gathering Station (GS) facility 5 of Chevron in Minas.It was the first time that a Sumatran tiger was found roaming near the oil facility in the morning, Suharyono stated.\"This is because the land and forest fires had destroyed the habitat, so this species had fled [from their habitat]. I hope that it would not be viewed as an enemy,\" he added.The tiger exited the compound by scaling a two-meter-high fence.He also confirmed that the Sumatran tiger is mature and healthy. The agency has sent a team to rescue the endangered species, Suharyono said.He believes the tiger was headed to the Sultan Syarif Hasyim Forest Park, located some 12 kilometers from the GS 5 area.Recently, Riau released two Sumatran tigers, named Bonita (female) and Atan (male), who had become involved in conflicts with local villagers.Bonita was rescued from a plantation in Tanjung Simpang Village in Indragiri Hilir District on January 3, 2018, while Atan was removed from a residential area in Burung Island, also in the district on November 18, 2018.In North Sumatra, a Sumatran tiger that had eaten a man and a goat last June was finally trapped and moved to West Sumatra's Dhamasraya Sumatran Tiger Rehabilitation Center in July 2019.\"The Barumun Sumatran Tiger Sanctuary in Padang Lawas, North Sumatra, can no longer accommodate additional tigers, as an adult male tiger named Monang, adult tigress called Gadis and two 10-month-old cubs are living there,\" Irzal Azhar, head of the North Sumatra Nature Resources Conservation Agency (BKSDA), said.The tiger was trapped on July 16, 2019, in Hutabargot Village, Sosopan Sub-district, Padang Lawas District, North Sumatra. The Sumatran tiger's right leg was possibly injured in a trap.The trap was set by the North Sumatra BKSDA, in cooperation with the Padang Lawas district authorities in May 2019, following several incidents.Forest fires often compel Sumatran tigers to leave their habitats and head further away in search of food.\"In case of a forest fire, an effort must be made to rescue tigers immediately,\" said Director General for Ecosystem and Natural Resource Conservation of the Environmental and Forestry Ministry Wiratno.The Ministry will focus on the preservation of Sumatran tigers by constructing a tiger rehabilitation center in Riau, Wiratno added.ANTARA",

Our stance remains the same if other political parties also invite him,\" he told journalists in Jakarta on Friday evening in connection with Baswedan's presence at the Nasdem Party's congress.Baswedan attended the opening session of the Surya Paloh-led party's congress in his capacity as the Jakarta governor, Taufik remarked.Tendering a clarification on a link between Baswedan's presence and the 2024 presidential elections, he stated that Gerindra will not question the party that is approaching the incumbent governor.Taufik noted that Baswedan is not a Gerindra cadre. Furthermore, this Prabowo Subianto-led party was one of the chief supporters of the Baswedan-Sandiaga Uno pair in the 2017 Jakarta regional elections.\"If he is nominated by others, Gerindra is great,\" he stated.In the meantime, Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan highlighted matters pertaining to unity during a speech he had delivered at the opening session of Nasdem Party's 2nd congress.He expressed belief that Nasdem would become a driver of the nation's combined efforts to preserve Indonesia's unity in diversity.He contended that the party leader, Surya Paloh, had recently set a shining example for the nation on practicing democracy in a manner that takes into account differing views.Baswedan recalled a notion mentioned in the declaration of the National Democratic Movement in 2010.\"The National Democratic Movement is keen to have a mature democracy that becomes a place for cementing diversity with unity, dynamism with order, competition with similarity, and freedom with welfare,” he affirmed.This sort of balance needs to be realized in Indonesia. \"This notion was read out at that time, and it is fought for since it is our hope in Jakarta,\" stated Anies Baswedan, concurrently one of the founders of this National Democratic Movement.ANTARA",
